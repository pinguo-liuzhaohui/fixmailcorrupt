   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
      AES [AES] is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm.  AES is
      a block cipher with a 128-, 192-, or 256-bit keys and a 16-byte
      block size.  TLS currently only supports the 128- and 256-bit key
      sizes.
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard

   asymmetric cipher
      See public key cryptography.

   authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD)
      A symmetric encryption algorithm that simultaneously provides
      confidentiality and message integrity.

   authentication
      Authentication is the ability of one entity to determine the
      identity of another entity.

   block cipher
      A block cipher is an algorithm that operates on plaintext in
      groups of bits, called blocks.  64 bits was, and 128 bits is, a
      common block size.

   bulk cipher
      A symmetric encryption algorithm used to encrypt large quantities
      of data.

   cipher block chaining (CBC)
      CBC is a mode in which every plaintext block encrypted with a
      block cipher is first exclusive-ORed with the previous ciphertext
      block (or, in the case of the first block, with the initialization
      vector).  For decryption, every block is first decrypted, then
      exclusive-ORed with the previous ciphertext block (or IV).

   certificate
      As part of the X.509 protocol (a.k.a. ISO Authentication
      framework), certificates are assigned by a trusted Certificate
      Authority and provide a strong binding between a party's identity
      or some other attributes and its public key.

   client write key
      The key used to encrypt data written by the client.

   client write MAC key
      The secret data used to authenticate data written by the client.

   connection
      A connection is a transport (in the OSI layering model definition)
      that provides a suitable type of service.  For TLS, such
      connections are peer-to-peer relationships.  The connections are
      transient.  Every connection is associated with one session.

   Data Encryption Standard
      DES [DES] still is a very widely used symmetric encryption
      algorithm although it is considered as rather weak now.  DES is a
      block cipher with a 56-bit key and an 8-byte block size.  Note
      that in TLS, for key generation purposes, DES is treated as having
      an 8-byte key length (64 bits), but it still only provides 56 bits
      of protection.  (The low bit of each key byte is presumed to be
      set to produce odd parity in that key byte.)  DES can also be
      operated in a mode [3DES] where three independent keys and three
      encryptions are used for each block of data; this uses 168 bits of
      key (24 bytes in the TLS key generation method) and provides the
      equivalent of 112 bits of security.
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard

   Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
      A standard for digital signing, including the Digital Signing
      Algorithm, approved by the National Institute of Standards and
      Technology, defined in NIST FIPS PUB 186-2, "Digital Signature
      Standard", published January 2000 by the U.S. Department of
      Commerce [DSS].  A significant update [DSS-3] has been drafted and
      was published in March 2006.
      
   Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
      Digital Signature Standard, which uses the Digital Signature Algorithm.
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm

   digital signatures
      Digital signatures utilize public key cryptography and one-way
      hash functions to produce a signature of the data that can be
      authenticated, and is difficult to forge or repudiate.

   handshake An initial negotiation between client and server that
      establishes the parameters of their transactions.

   Initialization Vector (IV)
      When a block cipher is used in CBC mode, the initialization vector
      is exclusive-ORed with the first plaintext block prior to
      encryption.

   Message Authentication Code (MAC)
      A Message Authentication Code is a one-way hash computed from a
      message and some secret data.  It is difficult to forge without
      knowing the secret data.  Its purpose is to detect if the message
      has been altered.
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code

   master secret
      Secure secret data used for generating encryption keys, MAC
      secrets, and IVs.

   MD5
      MD5 [MD5] is a hashing function that converts an arbitrarily long
      data stream into a hash of fixed size (16 bytes).  Due to
      significant progress in cryptanalysis, at the time of publication
      of this document, MD5 no longer can be considered a 'secure'
      hashing function.
      http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt

   public key cryptography
      A class of cryptographic techniques employing two-key ciphers.
      Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with
      the associated private key.  Conversely, messages signed with the
      private key can be verified with the public key.

   one-way hash function
      A one-way transformation that converts an arbitrary amount of data
      into a fixed-length hash.  It is computationally hard to reverse
      the transformation or to find collisions.  MD5 and SHA are
      examples of one-way hash functions.

   RC4 (Prohibited by RFC7465)
      A stream cipher invented by Ron Rivest.  A compatible cipher is
      described in [SCH].
      RFC7465 Prohibiting RC4 Cipher Suites, http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7465.txt

   RSA
      A very widely used public key algorithm that can be used for
      either encryption or digital signing.  [RSA]
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)

   session
      A TLS session is an association between a client and a server.
      Sessions are created by the handshake protocol.  Sessions define a
      set of cryptographic security parameters that can be shared among
      multiple connections.  Sessions are used to avoid the expensive
      negotiation of new security parameters for each connection.

   session identifier
      A session identifier is a value generated by a server that
      identifies a particular session.

   server write key
      The key used to encrypt data written by the server.

   server write MAC key
      The secret data used to authenticate data written by the server.

   SHA
      The Secure Hash Algorithm [SHS] is defined in FIPS PUB 180-2.  It
      produces a 20-byte output.  Note that all references to SHA
      (without a numerical suffix) actually use the modified SHA-1
      algorithm.

   SHA-256
      The 256-bit Secure Hash Algorithm is defined in FIPS PUB 180-2.
      It produces a 32-byte output.
      
  PRF （pseudorandom function）[Page 14]
     TLS's PRF is created by applying P_hash to the secret as:
      PRF(secret, label, seed) = P_<hash>(secret, label + seed)
    where + indicates concatenation.
    
   SSL (Deprecated by RFC7568)
      Netscape's Secure Socket Layer protocol [SSL3].  TLS is based on
      SSL Version 3.0.
      The 1996 draft of SSL 3.0 was published by IETF as a historical document in RFC6101, http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6101.txt
      RFC7568 Deprecating Secure Sockets Layer Version 3.0, http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7568.txt

   stream cipher
      An encryption algorithm that converts a key into a
      cryptographically strong keystream, which is then exclusive-ORed
      with the plaintext.

   symmetric cipher
      See bulk cipher.

   Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      This protocol; also, the Transport Layer Security working group of
      the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  See "Working Group
      Information" at the end of this document (see page 99).

      generating the write keys.

   IV Size
      The amount of data needed to be generated for the initialization
      vector.  Zero for stream ciphers; equal to the block size for
      block ciphers (this is equal to
