2.2.  Reserved Characters

      reserved    = gen-delims / sub-delims

      gen-delims  = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@"

      sub-delims  = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"
                  / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="


3.  Syntax Components

      URI         = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

      hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty
                  / path-absolute
                  / path-rootless
                  / path-empty

   The following are two example URIs and their component parts:

         foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
         \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
          |           |            |            |        |
       scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
          |   _____________________|__
         / \ /                        \
         urn:example:animal:ferret:nose

3.1.  Scheme

      scheme      = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )
      
   Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that 
   specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters.  An implementation should accept 
   uppercase letters as equivalent to lowercase in scheme names 
   (e.g., allow "HTTP" as well as "http") for the sake of robustness but should only
   produce lowercase scheme names for consistency.
   
3.2.  Authority

      authority   = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
      
   The authority component is preceded by a double slash ("//") and is
   terminated by the next slash ("/"), question mark ("?"), or number
   sign ("#") character, or by the end of the URI.

   URI producers and normalizers should omit the ":" delimiter that
   separates host from port if the port component is empty.  Some
   schemes do not allow the userinfo and/or port subcomponents.
   
   If a URI contains an authority component, then the path component
   must either be empty or begin with a slash ("/") character. 

3.2.1.  User Information
      
      userinfo    = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" )
      
   The user information, if present, is followed by a commercial at-sign ("@") that delimits it from the host.
   Use of the format "user:password" in the userinfo field is deprecated.
   
3.2.2.  Host
      
      host        = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
      
    The host subcomponent is case-insensitive.
    Although host is case-insensitive, producers and normalizers should use lowercase
    for registered names and hexadecimal addresses for the sake of
    uniformity, while only using uppercase letters for percent-encodings.
    
      IP-literal = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"
      IPvFuture  = "v" 1*HEXDIG "." 1*( unreserved / sub-delims / ":" )
      
    This is the only place where square bracket characters are allowed in the URI syntax.
